  <h1> Hello, CIS1250!</h1>
  <p>Netflix is one of the software I like its design. It is very easy to browse through their massive content library. With clear categories and big thumbnails, getting around the platform is very comfortable. Another great thing is that the experience remains smooth and consistent whether you’re using it on your TV, computer, or mobile device. When it comes to software, design plays a huge role in how people use and connect with a product. A well crafted interface doesn’t just look good, it also makes everything easier to use. Netflix is a perfect example of this. Its design helps users by offering previews and personalized recommendations, making choices quicker and more enjoyable. In today’s competitive world, smart design is what helps products stand out. It keeps users engaged, and comfortable which is critical for long-term success.
