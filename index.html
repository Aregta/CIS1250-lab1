	<h1 class="headers">Hello, CIS1250!</h1>
  
	<p>Netflix is one of the softwares I like its design. It is very easy to browse through their massive content library. With clear categories and big thumbnails, getting around the platform is very comfortable. Another great thing is that the experience remains smooth and consistent whether you’re using it on your TV, computer, or mobile device. When it comes to software, design plays a huge role in how people use and connect with a product. A well crafted interface doesn’t just look good, it also makes everything easier to use. Netflix is a perfect example of this. Its design helps users by offering previews and personalized recommendations, making choices quicker and more enjoyable. In today’s competitive world, smart design is what helps products stand out. It keeps users engaged, and comfortable which is critical for long-term success.</p>
  
	<p>The success of a software like Netflix is largely based on its ability to meet user needs through a user-friendly interface. In the requirements gathering stage, the development team works to understand what the users really want by preparing well thought questions to capture customer requirements and ideas. After gathering initial responses, follow up questions may be asked to clarify details. The team then lists the identified requirements by their priority, and examines any prerequisites that may need to be addressed before moving forward. This stage is crucial because it sets the foundation for the software’s design, features, and functionality. A well executed requirements gathering process ensures that the final product satisfies the users’ needs and enhances their overall experience, increasing the chances of the software’s success.</p>
