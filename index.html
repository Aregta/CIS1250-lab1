	<h1 class="headers">Hello, CIS1250!</h1>
  
	<p>Netflix is one of the softwares I like its design. It is very easy to browse through their massive content library. With clear categories and big thumbnails, getting around the platform is very comfortable. Another great thing is that the experience remains smooth and consistent whether you’re using it on your TV, computer, or mobile device. When it comes to software, design plays a huge role in how people use and connect with a product. A well crafted interface doesn’t just look good, it also makes everything easier to use. Netflix is a perfect example of this. Its design helps users by offering previews and personalized recommendations, making choices quicker and more enjoyable. In today’s competitive world, smart design is what helps products stand out. It keeps users engaged, and comfortable which is critical for long-term success.</p>
  
	<p>The success of a software like Netflix is largely based on its ability to meet user needs through a user-friendly interface. In the requirements gathering stage, the development team works to understand what the users really want by preparing well thought questions to capture customer requirements and ideas. After gathering initial responses, follow up questions may be asked to clarify details. The team then lists the identified requirements by their priority, and examines any prerequisites that may need to be addressed before moving forward. This stage is crucial because it sets the foundation for the software’s design, features, and functionality. A well executed requirements gathering process ensures that the final product satisfies the users’ needs and enhances their overall experience, increasing the chances of the software’s success.</p>

	<h3 class="headers">The Importance of Communication in Software Design</h3>
	<p>Communication is one of the most important elements of effective software design and development. It ensures that everyone involved has a shared understanding of the project’s goals and requirements. Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings, missed deadlines, and products that don't meet users' needs. Three key elements of effective communication are clarity, active listening, and feedback. Clarity helps to ensure that information is understood among everyone involved in the project. Active listening allows team members to fully understand each other's ideas and concerns. It can save time, and cause wonderfull brainstorms. Feedback provides a way to filter ideas and improve alignment on project goals, it is a must-have for a successful design. Better the feedbacks, better the improvements.</p>

	<p>In my own experience, I once encountered a communication issue during a group project. Some of our group members misunderstood each other's roles. As a result, some tasks were incomplete before the due date. This caused some parts of our presentation to be way less effective than I predicted. Reflecting on this, I realize that we could have benefited from clearer communication and more frequent check-ins. If I had applied active listening and ensured that we all confirmed our responsibilities, it would have prevented confusion. Now, having learned about these communication techniques, I understand the importance of setting clear expectations and regularly discussing our progress as a team. Effective communication not only enhances collaboration but also significantly contributes to the success of software projects.</p>
